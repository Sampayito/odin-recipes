<h2 class="wing1">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>5 pounds frozen chicken wings</li>
    <li>2 cups hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="wing1">Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Arrange frozen chicken wings in a single layer on a shallow baking dish.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes; flip wings over and continue to cook until crispy and no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, place hot sauce, butter, and vinegar in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until butter is melted, about 5 minutes. Whisk in flour until sauce is smooth; continue to cook and stir until sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes more.</li>
    <li>Drain grease from chicken wings and let stand for 5 minutes. Transfer chicken to a large bowl and add sauce. Toss to coat.</li>
</ol>
